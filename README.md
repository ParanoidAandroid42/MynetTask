# Special Powers Shooter Game - Demo

This is a demo project for an interview code challenge, built using Unity Version 2019.2.17f1. The game demonstrates basic mechanics such as auto-shooting, special power selection, and game state management.

## Features

- **Auto-Shooting**: The character automatically shoots bullets every 2 seconds.
- **Special Powers**: Players can choose from 5 different special powers to activate during the game.
- **Limitations**: Only 3 special powers can be activated per game session. Once 3 powers are selected, the others become inactive.
- **End Game**: The game screen includes a button to end the game and return to the main menu.

## Special Powers

1. **Triple Shot**: Adds two additional bullets that fire at 45-degree angles to the left and right.
2. **Double Shot**: Fires two consecutive bullets instead of one.
3. **Increased Firing Rate**: Reduces the shooting interval to 1 second.
4. **Increased Bullet Speed**: Increases the bullet speed by 50%.
5. **Clone Character**: Creates a clone of the character at a different location on the screen with the same shooting abilities.
